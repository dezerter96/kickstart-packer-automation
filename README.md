# 🚀 Introduction 
This is a clone of the Azure DevOps repository.
This repository is configured to build a virtual machine image 🖥️ that will be deployed in VirtualBox 📦.

# 🚩 Getting Started
The goal of this project is to use the Azure DevOps platform to create a virtual machine image for VirtualBox 🖥️📦.
Due to the limited infrastructure (home computer) 🏠💻, the project is designed to use the smallest possible hardware resources ⚙️🔋 to enable learning DevOps technologies 📚🚀.

Tools used for the project:
- Azure DevOps
- Packer

# 🔨 Build
##ks.cfg
The ks.cfg file is a Kickstart script that automates the installation of Rocky Linux with predefined settings 🖥️⚙️. Here's a brief description of its contents:
- Installation from the CDROM in text mode 📀
- Localization settings: Polish language, keyboard layout, and Europe/Warsaw timezone 🌍⌨️
- User configuration: root user with an encrypted password, creation of a user named "automation" with an encrypted password and passwordless sudo access 👤🔒
- Automatic network configuration using DHCP 🌐
- Disk partitioning with EFI, boot, LVM for system and home, and swap partitions 💽
- Installation of minimal environment and development packages 📦
- Addition of the EPEL repository ➕
- Post-installation mounts the VirtualBox Guest Additions ISO and installs the additions 📀➕
- Adds DNS entries to /etc/hosts 📝
- Sets up an SSH key for the "automation" user 🔑
- Automatic reboot after installation completes 🔄
This is a complete and automated installation script with full configuration of network, users, disks, and additional tools for use in a VirtualBox environment.

##variables.pkr.hcl
The variables.pkr.hcl file contains definitions of the required Packer plugins for VirtualBox 🖥️ and Vagrant 📦, as well as detailed configuration for building a Rocky Linux image from an ISO image 📀. This file specifies, among other things, virtual machine parameters (e.g., number of CPUs, RAM, disk size) ⚙️, SSH configuration 🔐, how to launch the Kickstart installation ⚙️, and exporting the finished image to a Vagrant-compatible format 🚀. This file allows you to automate the process of preparing Rocky Linux virtual machines.

##password_generator.py
The **password_generator.py** script is used to generate a hashed password using the crypt function. The user is prompted to enter a plain-text password, which is then hashed using the SHA-512 algorithm with a high number of rounds (656,000) to enhance security 🔒. The output is a hashed password in a format compatible with Linux system standards, suitable for use in configuration files for automatic user and password setup. Such a hashed password format is required in Kickstart files for secure and unattended password configuration during system installation 🖥️⚙️. This script simplifies the secure preparation of passwords for installation or system automation tasks.

# Azure Pipelines Configuration 🚀
This **azure-pipelines.yml** file defines a pipeline in Azure DevOps that automates building a Rocky Linux image and publishing it as a Vagrant box.  
trigger: none — The pipeline does not run automatically on commits or changes; it requires manual triggering ⏯️  
pool: lab — Jobs run on an agent from the "lab" agent pool 🖥️  
variables: — Uses a variable group named "Packer" defined in Azure DevOps 🔧  

steps:
- The first step initializes Packer and builds the image, passing the ssh_password variable from the variable group to the build process 🛠️
- The second step adds the generated VirtualBox image as a local Vagrant box 📦
- This pipeline enables automated creation and management of Rocky Linux virtual machine images using Packer and Vagrant within an Azure DevOps environment.
